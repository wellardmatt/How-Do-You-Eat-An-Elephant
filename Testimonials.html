It was also beneficial to have homework set which helped her to use this as part of her revision plan. I would definitely recommend using Matthew in the future."</p>

We only had three weeks with Matt in which to help prepare for her exams and, bearing in mind that we took him on at the eleventh hour, he truly did a stellar job at imparting a vast amount of knowledge in a very short time. His enthusiasm for the subject is second to none and, although my daughter isn't best enamoured with Maths he managed to increase her potential 'marks' exponentially. Well done Matt and thankyou so much from both of us!"</p>

		<p class="feedback">"Matthew has been an excellent maths tutor for my son over the last few months. He is very personable and communicates well with a 15 year old teenager who would rather be doing something else. His explanations are clear and he ensures that the student understands at each stage. He ensures that the work he does is in line with what student is doing at school by reviewing test results and workbooks and identifying where the student needs most support. He is patient and reliable and my son has said that he is better than any of his other teachers at school. That says it all. Thank you Matt."</p>

To whom it may concern.

Matthew has been working as a maths tutor to my son for several months. He is always
punctual and reliable, arriving in plenty of time to begin the lesson and often extends the
session to ensure that my son has completely understood.
He is very personable and relates well to my son. His patience and clear explanations have
helped to boost my sonâ€™s confidence and understanding of the subject. He demonstrates a real
enthusiasm for the subject and is able to relay this enthusiasm to my son.
Matthew comes well prepared for the lessons, ensuring that the topics he covers are in line
with those covered at college. He reviews the progress made and is able to identify the areas
where my son needs most support, spending time researching the syllabus and exam
specifications to ensure his teaching is correctly focussed. He has helped my son to develop a
better understanding of the subject and to become more logical and structured in his studies.
Matthewâ€™s calm, patient approach has ensured that my son is able to approach his exams with
more confidence and with a deeper understanding of the subject.
I have no hesitation in recommending Matthew for employment.

Yours faithfully,

K. A. Dixon
